# Collections - Part 2

The purpose of this exercise is reinforce understanding of the Dictionary class and how it is used.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise, students will understand:

* How to declare and create instances of Dictionary objects.
* How to iterate (loop through) key-value pairs in a Dictionary.
* How to determine if a Dictionary already contains a key.
* How to get and set a value with a key in a Dictionary.
* How to remove items from a Dictionary.
* How to navigate the Dictionary API documentation.

## Evaluation Criteria & Functional Requirements

* Dictionaries should be used rather than Lists or arrays.
* The project must not have any build errors.
* Unit tests pass as expected.
* Appropriate variable names and data types are being used.
* Code is presented in a clean, organized format.

## Getting Started

* Open the Exercises.sln solution in Visual Studio.
* Click on the **Test -> Run -> All Tests** Menu
* Click on the **Test Explorer** tab to see the results of your tests and which passed / failed.
* Provide enough code to get a test passing.
* Repeat until all tests are passing.

## Tips and Tricks

* **Note, If you find yourself stuck on a problem for longer than fifteen minutes, move onto the next, and try again later.**
* As a developer, you will find documentation for classes and libraries to be invaluable resources when completing your work. Get into the habit of reading and understanding documentation now to level up more quickly on your journey as a developer. For instance, the [Dictionary class][.net-core-dictionary-api-docs] (which you will be using for this exercise) is well documented.
* Before each method, there is a description of the problem that needs to be solved, as well as examples with expected output. Use these examples to get an idea of the values you need to write your code around. For example, in the comments above the `AnimalGroupName` method, there is a section that includes the method name, as well as the expected value that will be returned for each method call. The following example signifies that when the method is called with "giraffe", it will return the word "Tower".:
    ```
    AnimalGroupName("giraffe") â†’ "Tower"
    ```
* When you are trying to solve these sorts of problems, it is often helpful to keep track of the state of variables on a piece of paper as you are working through your code.
* The output of the test run can provide helpful clues as to why the tests are failing. Try reading the output of a failing test for more information that could be valuable when troubleshooting.
* You can also run the tests in debug mode when executing the tests. This will allow you to set a "breakpoint", which will then halt the code at certain points in the editor. You can then look at the values of variables while the test is executing, and can also see what code is currently being executed. Don't hesitate to use the debugging capabilities in Visual Studio to help resolve issues.
